# IntegrateChromatogram
Use this program to perform the same intergration analysis across multiple time-intensity data files, such as data gass/liquid chromotography analysis.

Select a folder to read your time-intensity data files in .xlsx or .csv format (make sure it only contains the files you want to be read), change the intergration parameters in the table and select process to perform the analysis. The output is written to an .csv file and integrations can be checked by cycling through using the "Chromatogram spinner".
